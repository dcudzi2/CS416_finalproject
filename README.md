# CS416_finalproject

This is the final project submission for CS416 at UIUC for the summer of 2023. This final project is a narrative data visualization display implemented as an interactive webpage implementing D3 programming in JabaScript. The overall structure of this visualization is designed to be a [DRILL DOWN STORY?] showcasing data from [DIG UP THE OLD AQI STUFF FROM THE EPA].

More details are forthcoming, and an essay will be included in the README too.
